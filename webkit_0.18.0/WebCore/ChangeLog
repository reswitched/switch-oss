        Normally when an element gets blockified (inline -> block) we destroy its renderer and construct a new one (RenderInline -> RenderBlock).
        During this process the associated inline boxtree gets destroyed as well. Since RenderListMarker is just a generic RenderBox, the blockifying
        change does not require a new renderer.

        [MSE] Use tolerance in eraseBeginTime
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195911

        Reviewed by Jer Noble.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190085 introduced tolerance
        when erasing frames during the Coded Frame Processing algorithm in
        such a way that, in files with less than perfect timestamps, a frame
        existing before after the current append is not erased accidentally
        due to small overlaps.

        This patch takes care of the opposite problem: we don't want an old
        frame being accidentally NOT erased by a new one with the same
        timestamps just because these overlaps make
        highestPresentationTimestamp very slightly higher than the frame PTS.

        This bug in practice causes some frames of the old quality to not be
        erased when the new quality is appended, resulting in some seemingly
        still frames from a different quality appearing at some points during
        WebM video in presence of quality changes.

        This bug can be reduced to this minimal test case that illustrates the
        timestamp imprecission of a typical WebM file:

        function sampleRun(generation) {
            return concatenateSamples([
                makeASample(     0,      0, 166667, 1000000, 1, SAMPLE_FLAG.SYNC, generation),
                makeASample(167000, 167000, 166667, 1000000, 1, SAMPLE_FLAG.NONE, generation),
                makeASample(333000, 333000, 166667, 1000000, 1, SAMPLE_FLAG.SYNC, generation), // overlaps previous frame
                makeASample(500000, 500000, 166667, 1000000, 1, SAMPLE_FLAG.NONE, generation),
            ]);
        }

        After appending this twice it would be expected that the second
        generation takes fully over the first, since the timestamps are
        completely the same. Due to the bug, sync frames with an overlap, like
        the third one in that list, actually persist from the first
        generation, due to lack of tolerance when comparing the start of a new
        frame with highestPresentationTimestamp.

        This patch introduces the tolerance in that case too to fix this
        problem.

        later used to find the matching float box in the per-block-flow float list.
        This logic works fine as long as the lists and the index manipulation are tightly coded.
        However due to the complexity of the line/float layout code, this is no longer the case.

        This patch makes float box handling more secure by changing this index based setup
        to a list iterator. It helps to eliminate potential vector overflow issues.

        LineLayoutState::FloatList (new class) keeps track of all the floats for the block flow.
        It groups the float box related functions/members and provides an iterator interface to ensure safer
        syncing between this and the line based floats.

        No change in functionality.

        RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible() should not propagate a subframe's scroll to its cross-origin parent
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=185664
        <rdar://problem/36185260>

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible() should not propagate a subframe's scroll to its
        cross-origin parent. There was logic in FrameLoader::scrollToFragmentWithParentBoundary()
        to temporarily set the 'safeToPropagateScrollToParent' flag to false on the cross-origin
        ancestor frame during the call to FrameView::scrollToFragment(). This would correctly
        prevent RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible() to propagate the scroll to the cross-origin
        ancestor frame when scrollRectToVisible() is called synchronously. However,
        scrollRectToVisible() can get called asynchronously in case of a dirty layout, as part
        of the post layout tasks.

        To address the issue, we get rid of the safeToPropagateScrollToParent flag on FrameView
        and instead update FrameView::safeToPropagateScrollToParent() to do the cross-origin
        check. FrameView::safeToPropagateScrollToParent() is called by RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible()
        and this is a lot more robust than relying on a flag which gets temporarily set.

        Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

        According to https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html#TextLayout, the <text>
        element has to be laid out as if it were a block element and any <tspan>,
        <textPath>, <a> and <tref> descendants were inline elements.

        If a css rule, which contains the property "display: block;", is applied
        to any of children of a <text> element, this property has to be ignored.

        We currently ignore this property in RenderSVGInline::updateFromStyle()
        by forcing setInline(true). But we do not do the same thing in 
        RenderTreeBuilder::normalizeTreeAfterStyleChange(). In fact we allow
        making the children of the <text> element to be non-inline. This puts
        the render tree in weired state and causes many assertions to fire while
        laying out RenderSVGText.

        Document should not be mutated under SMILTimeContainer::updateAnimations()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186658

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        To update the animation of an SVG <animate> element, we call
        SVGAnimateElementBase::resetAnimatedType(). It ensures the pointer m_animator
        is valid. If it animates a css property, it calls computeCSSPropertyValue()
        which calls resolveStyle() via other calls. resolveStyle() may call delayed
        callbacks through the destructor of PostResolutionCallbackDisabler. These
        callbacks may fire events. These events may execute JS event handlers.
        If one of these event handlers deletes the same SVG <animate> we animate,
        we will end up calling SVGAnimateElementBase::resetAnimatedPropertyType()
        of the same <animate> element. This function  will delete the same m_animator
        which resetAnimatedType() still holds and will use later. This code
        re-entrance is unexpected and unwanted.

        The fix is to disable mutating the DOM while updating the SVG animations.

        Due to a limitation of the pixman backend, which uses 16 bits to hold signed integers, cairo is
        not able to draw anything when using transformation matrices with values bigger than 32768. When
        drawing patterns into large pages, the matrices values can overflow those 16 bits, so cairo doesn't
        draw anything in, which causes the reported transparent backgrounds.

        The patch modifies the transformation matrices both from the current context and the pattern we
        are painting, to avoid them to hold values that cannot stored in 16 bits.

        There's still the possibility that this happens, but it would require using a pattern with a size
        bigger than 32768.

        Based on a previous patch by Gwang Yoon Hwang  <yoon@igalia.com>.

        [Cairo] Remove the cairo_glyph_t complexity from GlyphBuffer
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177598

        Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

        Remove the decade-old use of cairo_glyph_t as the underlying type for
        Glyph. The former spans 24 bytes in size, while the latte is just 2
        bytes. The x and y coordinate attributes of cairo_glyph_t were only
        used in FontCascade::drawGlyphs() implementation, where they were
        overridden even if the same GlyphBuffer object was used here repeatedly.

        FontCascade::drawGlyphs() now creates a new Vector<cairo_glyph_t> object
        and fills it only with the glyph index and coordinates data for glyphs
        that will actually be drawn. This will likely in the future be leveraged
        to pack the necessary data and perform the drawing operations in
        parallelized tasks. GlyphBuffer usages that before required USE(CAIRO)
        special-casing can now be simplified.

        This also removes the need for <cairo.h> header inclusion in the
        GlyphBuffer.h header. This further removes Cairo header inclusion in
        roughly 600 build targets.

        No new tests -- no change in behavior.

    The Windows implementation of GlyphBuffer has an additional member, m_offsets, which represents
    an additional offset to the position to paint each glyph. It also has two add() functions, one
    which appends to this vector, and one which doesn't. The one that doesn't append to the vector
    should never be called on Windows (because Windows requires this vector to be full).
    
    There were two situations where it was getting called:
    1) Inside ComplexTextController
    2) Inside display list playback
    
    Windows shouldn't be using ComplexTextController because the Windows implementation of this
    class isn't ready yet; instead it should be using UniscribeController. The display list playback
    code should be used on Windows.
    
    Rather than fix the function to append an offset, we actually don't need the m_offsets vector
    in the first place. Instead, we can do it the same way that the Cocoa ports do it, which is to
    bake the offsets into the glyph advances. This is possible because the GlyphBuffer doesn't need
    to distinguish between layout advances and paint advances, so we can bake them together and
    just put paint advances in the GlyphBuffer. This should be a small (probably within-the-noise)

        REGRESSION (r228299): Broke reader mode in Safari
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182697
        <rdar://problem/37399012>

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        Rework the fix for r228299 to be more targeted. I moved the policy check
        cencelation from FrameLoader::stopLoading() to NavigationScheduler::schedule()
        when a pending load is cancelled by another load. I have verified that the
        sites fixed by r228299 still work with this more limited change. However,
        reader mode is now working again.

        The issue seems to be that we tell CFNetwork to continue with the load after
        receiving the response, even if the client has not responded to the
        decidePolicyForNavigationResponse delegate yet. As a result, CFNetwork sends
        us the resource data and we may commit the provisional load before receiving
        the policy response from the client. When the provisional load is committed,
        we call FrameLoader::stopLoading() which after r228299 cancelled pending
        policy checks. Because we did not wait for the policy check response to
        commit the load, we would cancel it which would make the load fail.

        The real fix here would be to make not tell CFNetwork to continue until after
        we've received the policy delegate response. However, this is a larger and
        riskier change at this point. I will follow-up on this issue.

        Covered by new API test.

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        Before r210226, the render tree being torn down and the document being destroyed
        were roughly the same thing, since they would always happen together, from the
        render tree's perspective.

        Changing this caused us to skip over the code that saves the scroll position
        for an element's RenderLayer when going into the page cache. Navigating back to
        that page would then scroll the layer to (0,0) instead of the previous position.

        The fix is simply to remove the check for documentBeingDestroyed() in ~RenderLayer().
        Note that two checks are being removed, there was also a weird "optimization"
        to avoid nulling out EventHandler's m_resizeLayer if it points to this layer.
        That pointer would eventually get nulled out in EventHandler::clear() anyway,
        but it feels better to not let that pointer dangle.

        The problem was that tearDownRenderers() would cause commit Widget hierarchy updates
        before returning, which is just before Document clears its m_renderView pointer.
        This led to an awkward callback into Page::setActivityState() which ended up trying
        to clear the selection inside a partially dead render tree.

        Fix this by adding a WidgetHierarchyUpdatesSuspensionScope to Document::destroyRenderTree()
        which ensures that Widget updates don't happen until after Document::m_renderView is cleared.

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        In macOS 10.13.2, CoreMedia changed the definition of CMSampleBufferGetDuration() to return
        the presentation duration rather than the decode duration. For media streams where those two
        durations are identical (or at least, closely similar), this isn't a problem. But the media
        file used in the WPT tests have an unusual frame cadence: decode durations go {3000, 1, 5999,
        1, 5999,...} and presentation durations go {3000, 2999, 3000, 2999}. This caused one check in
        the "Coded Frame Processing" algorithm to begin failing, where it checks that the delta
        between the last sample's decode time and the new decode time is no more than 2x as far as
        the last sample's duration. That's not a problem as long as the "duration" is the "decode
        duration" and the samples are all adjacent. Once the "duration" is "presentation duration",
        all the assumptions in the algorithm are invalidated. In the WPT test case, the delta between
        decode times is 5999, and 2 * the presentation duration is 5998, causing all samples up to
        the next sync sample to be dropped.

        To work around this change in behavior, we'll adopt the same technique used by Mozilla's MSE
        implementation, which was done for similar reasons. Rather than track the "last frame duration",
        we'll record the "greatest frame duration", and use actual decode timestamps to derive this
        duration. The "greatest frame duration" field will be reset at the same times as "last frame
        duration", and will be used only in the part of the algorithm that checks for large decode
        timestamp gaps.

            When decidePolicyForNavigationAction is responded to asynchronously during a client redirect,
            HistoryController::updateForRedirectWithLockedBackForwardList does not update the history because
            the document loader has not been marked as a client redirect because the FrameLoader only looks
            at its provisional document loader to mark it as a client redirect.  When decidePolicyForNavigationAction
            is responded to asynchronously, though, the FrameLoader's provisional document loader has moved to
            its policy document loader.  To get both asynchronous and synchronous cases, let's just mark the document
            loader as a client redirect whether it's the provisional or policy document loader.

        Remove ClientCredentialPolicy cross-origin option from ResourceLoaderOptions
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159413

        Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

        ClientCredentialPolicy had three values (not ask, ask, ask only for same origin).
        The distinction between allowing cross-origin or same-origin credentials is misleading as it is not supported
        for synchronous loads and not supported by Network process.
        It is best replaced by a boolean option (ask or not ask).

        Same-origin ClientCredentialPolicy option was only used by DocumentThreadableLoader for asynchronous loads.
        Since DocumentThreadableLoader is already computing whether the request is cross-origin, it can also compute
        whether credentials may be requested or not. In case of cross-origin redirections, credentials are omitted, thus
        disabling any possibility for requesting credentials for cross-origin resources after redirections.

        Moving ClientCredentialPolicy to ResourceLoaderOptions since it is not used by platform code except for some
        mac-specific code that is already using ResourceLoaderOptions.

            Before resetting the animation value (and destroying the assigned SVG object -SVGLengthValue in this case),
            we need to check if there's an associated tear off wrapper for the said SVG object and make a copy of it.

            gl.detachShader breaks shader program

            It should be possible to compile shaders, attach them to a program,
            link the program, detach the shaders, delete the shaders, and then
            ask for the uniform and attribute locations. That is, once you've
            linked, the shaders can be thrown away.

            We were using the attached shaders to look up uniform locations, so
            we now keep around a separate map that remembers what shaders were
            attached when the program links.

            This fixes the bug, but the whole area is still a bit messy. For one,
            we're keeping around all the shader information even after it is
            no longer used.

            Test: media/video-restricted-invisible-autoplay-not-allowed-source.html

            The media session is notified that its client (the media element) will begin autoplaying inside
            prepareForLoad(), where the m_autoplaying flag is also set. But loading via <source> elements does not go
            through prepareForLoad(); the HTML standard states that the <source> element loading path does not trigger the
            "media element load algorithm" which is implemented in prepareForLoad(). Since the m_autoplaying flag is
            initially set to true, notify the media session that the element will begin autoplaying inside the element's
            constructor.

            Drive-by fix: Doing the above causes other tests to crash, as purturbing play state during style change can cause
            re-entrancy in the native controls code, or fail, since we will transition from autoplay -> play even if there's
            not yet a src or source to the media element. Add a task queue for updating the autoplay state and check the ready

            DeleteSelectionCommand can cause a null dereference if editable start and end positions are not found. This can
            happen when attempting to delete after selecting the contents within a canvas or output element with `read-write`
            `-webkit-user-modify` style. To fix this, we make the initialization step of the DeleteSelectionCommand robust
            when editable start and end positions are missing.

        Parsing errors are reported to the main script's window.onerror function.  AFAIK,
        both Chrome and Firefox have the error reporting mechanism use an internal

        or proxies instead.

        This patch fixes this issue by matching Chrome and Firefox's behavior.

        When the renderer that is being destroyed is on a selection boundary,
        we need to ensure that all its cached pointers across the selection code (e.g. SelectionSubtreeData)
        are getting reset. In order to do that, we call clearSelection() on the RenderView.
        One of the last steps of clearing selection is to collect the selection gaps. Selection gaps uses this
        LogicalSelectionOffsetCaches helper class to collect selection information across blocks.
        LogicalSelectionOffsetCaches normally operates on rooted renderers. However we need to ensure sure that
        it can also handle renderers that are no longer part of the render tree.

        The error handler of ReadableJSStream should own stream object
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148653

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        ReadableJSStream's m_errorFunction does not own the readable stream.
        So when this error callback is executed asynchronously through Promises,
        the stream could be already destroyed.
        The fulfill callback which is jointly configured with this error callback
        owns the stream. However, when the promise is rejected, the following things
        occur.

        1. Promise clears the fulfill handlers immediately.
        2. queue the reject handlers to the microtask queue.
        3. When draining the microtasks, the rejected handler will be executed.

        At the time of 2 or 3, the references to the fulfill handlers are already discarded.
        So when GC occurs at the time of 2 or 3, it will collect the fulfill handlers and the
        stream object owned by the fulfill handlers even if the error callback will touch the
        stream object later.

        Before r189124, this fault does not occur. This is because the std::function in the
        fulfill handler is not destroyed before that patch. Since the std::function owns the
        stream object, the std::function and the stream object were leaked and never destroyed.
        After that patch, the std::function in the fulfill handler becomes destroyed. And it
        makes this fault happen.

        In this patch, we separate the error callback from the stream object. Previously, the
        error callback resides in the stream object as the member. To avoid the cyclic references,
        this error callback did not own the stream object. But this causes this fault.
        Instead of caching the error callback in the stream object, we always create the error
        callback, when it is needed. The created error callback owns the stream object as well as
        the fulfill callbacks owns the stream object.

        No behavior change.

        Event handlers should not be called in frameless documents
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173233

        Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

        As per the HTML specification [1], for event handlers on elements, we should use the
        element's document to check if scripting is disabled [2]. Scripting is considered to
        be disabled if the document has no browsing context (i.e. a frame in WebKit terms).

        In JSLazyEventListener::initializeJSFunction(), instead of using the element's
        document to do the checks, we would use the script execution context. In most cases,
        a node's document and its script execution context are the same so this is not an
        issue. However, if the node's document is a document created via JS, its nodes'
        script execution context will be the document's context document (i.e the one that
        created the document, see implementation of Node::scriptExecutionContext()). In those
        cases, using the wrong document is an issue because the document's context document
        (aka script execution context) may allow scripting but we still do not want to call
        the event handler because its document is frameless.

        This impacts documents created by JS, using the following APIs:
        - DOMParser.parseFromHTML
        - new Document()
        - DOMImplementation.createDocument / createHTMLDocument
        - XHRs whose responseType is Document.

        REGRESSION(r191731): SVGPatternElement can only reference another SVGPatternElement in the same SVG document
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176221

        According to the specs:

        https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#PatternElementHrefAttribute

        The xlink:href attribute of the SVG filter, gradient and pattern elements
        must reference another element within the current SVG of the same type.

        In r191731, the code of SVGPatternElement::collectPatternAttributes() was
        removed and replaced by RenderSVGResourcePattern::collectPatternAttributes()
        to avoid cyclic reference in the pattern element. The problem is the old
        code used to check whether the referenced element is<SVGPatternElement>
        before casting it. This code was not copied to the new function. So we
        now allow the SVGPatternElement to reference any SVG resource element.

        To fix this issue, we need to prevent SVGResources from chaining an incorrect
        type of element to the SVG filter, gradient and pattern elements.

        We also need to use the SVGResources for getting the referenced element
        when collecting the attributes for the gradient elements. SVGResources solves
        the cyclic referencing issue so there is no need to repeat the same code
        in many places. Also, from now on the SVGResources will have valid linked
        resource only. So casting the referenced element should always be valid.

        a NoEventDispatchAssertion object to enforce the invariant that no additional DOM events are
        dispatched as part of adding a page to the page cache. When adding a page with a focused
        subframe to the page cache we focus its main frame, which implicitly defocuses the subframe
        and dispatches a DOM blur event at it. Therefore an assertion failure occurs when dispatching
        this DOM blur event (because a NoEventDispatchAssertion object was allocated on the stack).

        REGRESSION(r181345): SVG polyline and polygon leak page
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=152759

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        The leak happens because of cyclic reference between SVGListPropertyTearOff 
        and SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff which is derived from SVGAnimatedProperty.
        There is also cyclic reference between SVGAnimatedProperty and SVGElement
        and this causes the whole document to be leaked. So if the JS requests, for
        example, an instance of SVGPolylineElement.points, the whole document will be
        leaked.

        The fix depends on having the cyclic reference as is since the owning and the
        owned classes have to live together if any of them is referenced. But the owning
        class caches a raw 'ref-counted' pointer of the owned class. If it is requested
        for an instance of the owned class it returned a RefPtr<> of it. Once the owned
        class is not used, it can delete itself. The only thing needed here is to notify
        the owner class of the deletion so it cleans its caches and be able to create a
        new pointer if it is requested for an instance of the owned class later.

        Revert the change of r181345 in SVGAnimatedProperty::lookupOrCreateWrapper()
        to break the cyclic reference between SVGElement and SVGAnimatedProperty.
        
        Also apply the same approach in SVGAnimatedListPropertyTearOff::baseVal() and
        animVal() to break cyclic reference between SVGListPropertyTearOff and

        A crash reproducible in Path::isEmpty() under RenderSVGShape::paint()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149613

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        When RenderSVGRoot::layout() realizes its layout size has changed and
        it has resources which have relative sizes, it marks all the clients of
        the resources for invalidates regardless whether they belong to the
        same RenderSVGRoot or not. But it reruns the layout only for its children.
        If one of these clients comes before the current RenderSVGRoot in the render
        tree, ee end up having renderer marked for invalidation at rendering time.
        This also prevents scheduling the layout if the same renderer is marked
        for another invalidation later. We prevent this because we do not want
        to schedule another layout for a renderer which is already marked for
        invalidation. This can cause crash if the renderer is an RenderSVGPath.
        
        The fix is to mark "only" the clients of a resource which belong to the
        same RenderSVGRoot of the resource. Also we need to run the layout for
        all the resources which belong to different RenderSVGRoots before running
        the layout for an SVG renderer.

        Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

        The bug was caused by a flawed sequence of steps we took to remove an element. When an element is removed,
        willRemoveChild and willRemoveChildren fire blur events on removed focused element and its ancestors and
        unload event on any removed iframes. However, it was possible to focus an element on which we had fired blur
        during an unload event, leaving m_focusedElement point to an element that's not in the document anymore.

        Changing the order doesn't help because that would make it possible to insert the removed iframes back into
        the document inside a event listener of the blur event, which was specifically fixed by r127534 four years ago.

        Instead, fix the bug by not firing blur and change events on removed nodes. New behavior matches Firefox and HTML5

            Currently, TextFieldInputType::forwardEvent synchronously triggers style recomputation, for the purpose of
            scrolling to the origin upon handling a blur event, and also for updating caps lock state after a blur or focus.
            In synchronously triggering style recomputation, we may end up running arbitrary JavaScript, which may change
            the HTMLInputElement's type and cause the current TextFieldInputType to be destroyed.

            To mitigate this, we only update caps lock state when forwarding a focus or blur event to the InputType, and
            instead scroll blurred text fields to the origin later, in HTMLInputElement::didBlur (invoked from
            Document::setFocusedElement after blur and focusout events have fired). Instead of having the InputType update
            style, lift the call to Document::updateStyleIfNeeded up into HTMLInputElement so that we gracefully handle the
            case where the page destroys and sets a new InputType within the scope of this style update.

            Submitting a form can cause HTMLFormElement's associated elements vector to be mutated during iteration
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176368

            In the process of iterating over form.associatedElements() during form submission in FormSubmission::create, the
            page may cause us to clobber the vector of FormAssociatedElements* we're currently iterating over by inserting
            new form controls beneath the form element we're in the process of submitting. This happens because
            FormSubmission::create calls HTMLTextAreaElement::appendFormData, which requires layout to be up to date, which
            in turn makes us updateLayout() and set focus, which fires a `change` event, upon which the page's JavaScript
            inserts additonal DOM nodes into the form, modifying the vector of associated elements.

            To mitigate this, instead of iterating over HTMLFormElement::associatedElements(), which returns a reference to
            the HTMLFormElement's actual m_associatedElements vector, we iterate over a new vector of
            Ref<FormAssociatedElement>s created from m_associatedElements.

            This patch also removes an event dispatch assertion added in r212026. This assertion was added to catch any
            other events dispatched in this scope, since dispatching events there would have had security implications, but
            after making iteration over associated elements robust, this NoEventDispatchAssertion is no longer useful.

            Adopting a child node of a script element can run script
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167318

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            The bug was caused by ScriptElement::childrenChanged indiscriminately running the script.
            Do this only if some node has been inserted as spec'ed:

            https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#script-processing-model
            "The script element is connected and a node or document fragment is inserted into
            the script element, after any script elements inserted at that time."

            Split NonContentsChildChanged into NonContentsChildInserted and NonContentsChildRemoved to disambiguate
            non-contents child such as text and element being removed or inserted. New behavior matches that of
            Gecko and Chrome as well as the latest HTML5 specification.

            Also deploy NoEventDispatchAssertion in more places. Unfortunately, this results in some DOM trees
            internal to WebKit to be mutated while there is NoEventDispatchAssertion in the stack. Added a new RAII
            object "EventAllowedScope" to temporarily disable this assertion within such a tree. CachedSVGFont's
            ensureCustomFontData used to completely disable this assertion but we no longer have to do this either.

            To clarify the new semantics, renamed isEventDispatchForbidden to isEventAllowedInMainThread with
            the negated boolean value, and added a new variant isEventDispatchAllowedInSubtree, which checks
            isEventDispatchForbidden() is true or if the node was one of an internal DOM node or its descendent
            held by EventAllowedScope.

            RenderImageResourceStyleImage::m_cachedImage will be set to null at the

        [iOS DnD] Web process uses too much memory when beginning a drag on a very large image
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174585
        <rdar://problem/33302541>

        Reviewed by Tim Horton.

        Currently, attempting to drag a very large image fails, either due to us telling CoreGraphics to create an image
        buffer that is too large, or because the web process exceeds its memory limit and gets jetsamed. There are two
        places where we can optimize our memory use during the drag initialization sequence, and this patch improves
        both.

        First, on iOS, we attempt to encode and send over a WebCore::Image in the PasteboardImage when writing to the
        item providers upon starting a drag. Currently, this Image is only used in the drag and drop codepath, in
        PlatformPasteboard::writeObjectRepresentations, to grab the size of the image being written for the purpose of
        specifying estimated display size. Serializing and deserializing an Image calls into Image::nativeImage, which
        attempts to draw the contents of the image into a buffer so that it can be shipped across to the UI process.
        Instead, we can simply compute the size in the web process while we already have the Image, and simply send that
        across. For copy/paste, this doesn't result in any behavior change, since we don't use the PasteboardImage's
        image in the first place.

        Secondly, when starting a drag, we try to allocate create an image buffer the size of the WebCore::Image for the
        purpose of generating the drag preview. Instead, this patch establishes a limit on the size of this drag preview
        image, such that if the Image's size is larger, we'll scale down the drag preview image to be the maximum
        allowed size.

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        JSDOMWindowCustom getOwnPropertySlot currently allows cross-origin access to all
        static properties, relying on the property to perform the access check. This is
        a little insecure, since it is error prone - someone could easily add a property
        to the static table without realizing it would be automatcially exposed.

        Instead, add a hard-coded filter to restrict access. As a future implementation
        we might consider autogenerating this (the properties are already tagged in IDL,
        we might be able to track this in a flag on the static table).

        By separating out the handling of the same- and cross-origin access we can

        Dynamic background color changes do not update until a layout is forced
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=131623

        Compute correct repaint rect for decorated RenderSVGRoots.

        The current implementation of clippedOverflowRectForRepaint() uses the
        generic repaint-rect calculations in SVGRenderSupport. Those in turn make
        use of repaintRectInLocalCoordinates(), which for RenderSVGRoot is the
        union of the painted children (w/ some expansion). If there're no children,
        or they do not fill the entire content box, then a repaint would not
        repaint the correct parts.
        Fix by calculating the union of the border-box and the SVG content
        when the SVG root is decorated (has background/border/etc.)

        When due to some style change, a renderer's self-painting layer is getting destroyed 
        and the parent's overflow is no longer set to visible, we don't clean up the overflow part.

        When a renderer has a self-painting layer, the parent stops tracking the child's 
        visual overflow rect. All overflow painting is delegated to the self-painting layer.
        However when this layer gets destroyed, no-one issues repaint to clean up
        the overflow bits.
        This patch ensures that we issue a repaint when the self-painting layer is destroyed
        and the triggering style change requires full repaint.

        Optimization in Node.insertBefore() is not spec-compliant
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160746

        Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

        We have an optimization in Node.insertBefore(newNode, refChild) to avoid
        doing any work when newNode == refChild or newNode.nextSibling == refChild.

        This optimization is not in the specification:
        - https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-replace

        The issue is that this optimization is observable with DOM mutation
        observers / listeners or DOM ranges.

        This patch addresses the issue by dropping the optimization. This case
        does not seem common enough to be worth optimizing for. However, if it
        turns out to regress the performance of things we care about, we could
        fallback to doing the optimization only when it is not observable.

        This affects the following API: Node.insertBefore(), Node.appendChild(),

        WebKit current fails to do the following checks whenever the parent is a
        Document from pre-insertion validation:
        1. If the inserted Node is a DocumentFragment, we should make sure it
          contains only one Element.
        -> This is because a Document can have only one child that is an
           Element [1].
        2.a. If an Element is inserted, we should make sure it is not inserted
             before a DocumentType.
        2.b. If a DocumentType is inserted, we should make sure it is not
             inserted after an Element.
        -> This is because the DocType must come before the optional Element
           child [1].

        Firefox and Chrome already match the specification here. This patch

        Node.appendChild(null) / replaceChild(null, null) / removeChild(null)
        and insertBefore(null, ref) should throw a TypeError instead of a
        NotFoundError, as per the specification:
        https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#node

        The parameters are not nullable so the Web IDL specification says
        we should throw a TypeError in this case.

        This patch moves the null-checking from ContainerNode to the methods
        on Node. The null-checking is supposed to be done by the bindings code
        but our generator currently does not support this so we do the null
        checking as close to the bindings as possible. The bindings code is
        calling the methods on Node. This also makes sure we throw a TypeError
        for null-argument when the Node is not a ContainerNode. For e.g.
        Text.appendChild(null) should throw a TypeError too.

        The methods on ContainerNode now take references insteaad of pointer
        parameters now that the null-checking is done at the call site in
        Node. This lead to a lot of code update as those methods are used
        a lot throughout the code base.

        No new tests, already covered by pre-existing layout tests.

        when the element was in the tree but with its inDocument still being
        false (because insertedInto() has not been called yet). This could
        end up calling HTMLFormElement::registerFormElement() even though
        the element is still recognized as detached. This is an issue because
        HTMLFormElement::m_associatedElements's order and its corresponding
        indexes (m_associatedElementsBeforeIndex / m_associatedElementsAfterIndex)
        rely on the position of the element with regards to the form element
        (before / inside / after).

        To address the issue, we now only register the FormAttributeTargetObserver
        in didMoveToNewDocument() if the inDocument flag is set to true. This
        is similar to what is done at other call sites of
        resetFormAttributeTargetObserver(). We also ignore the form content
        attribute in HTMLFormElement::formElementIndex() if the element is
        not connected.

        As per the HTML specification [1], the form content attribute is only
        taken if the element is connected (i.e. inDocument flag is true).

        Note that FormAssociatedElement::findAssociatedForm() was already
        ignoring the form content attribute if the element is disconnected.

        When registering a RenderElement for viewport visibility callbacks, we always need to make sure that it is unregistered
        before it is destroyed. While we account for this in the destructor of RenderElement, we only unregister in the destructor
        if we are already registered for visibility callbacks. In the call to RenderObject::willBeDestroyed(), we clear out rare
        data, which holds RenderElement's viewport callback registration state, so upon entering the destructor of RenderElement,
        we skip unregistration because RenderElement thinks that it is not registered.

        We can mitigate this by unregistering the RenderElement earlier, in RenderElement::willBeDestroyed, prior to clearing out
        the rare data. However, we'd ideally want to move the cleanup logic out of the destructor altogether and into willBeDestroyed

        [iOS] Playback does not pause when deselecting route and locking screen.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148724

        Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

        When deselecting a route, the route change notification can be delayed for some amount
        of time. If the screen is locked before the notification is fired, the PlatformMediaSessionManager
        can refuse to pause the video when entering the background due to a wireless playback route
        still being active.

        When the media element transitions from having an active route to not having one (or vice versa),
        re-run the interruption check. In order to correctly determine, when that occurs, whether
        we are in an 'application background' state, cache that value to an ivar when handling
        application{Will,Did}Enter{Background,Foreground}.

        Because we only want to run this step during an actual transition between playing to a route ->
        playing locally, cache the value of isPlayingToWirelessPlayback to another ivar, and only
        inform the PlatformMediaSessionManager when that value actually changes.

        When drawing the spin buttons, override the width of the input

        This ensures that we don't end up covering the input values with

        Do this also for user controlled styles, because most web authors
        won't test how their site renders on WebKitGTK+, and they will
        assume spin buttons in the order of 13 pixels wide (that is what
        most browsers use), but the GTK+ spin button is much wider (66 pixels).

            Change the MemoryCache and CachedResource adjustSize functions to take a long argument
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162708

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            Because the MemoryCache stores the size of the cached memory in unsigned,
            two problems my happen when reporting a change in the size of the memory:

            1. Signed integer overflow -- which can happen because MemoryCache::adjustSize()
               takes a signed integer argument. If the allocated or the freed memory size is
               larger than the maximum of a signed integer, an overflow will happen.
               For the image caching code, this can be seen where the unsigned decodedSize
               is casted to an integer before passing it to ImageObserver::decodedSizeChanged().

            2. Unsigned integer overflow -- which can happen if the new allocated memory
               size plus the currentSize exceeds the maximum of unsigned.
               This can be seen in MemoryCache::adjustSize() where we add delta to m_liveSize
               or m_deadSize without checking whether this addition will overflow or not. We
               do not assert for overflow although we assert for underflow.

            The fix for these two problems can be the following:

            1. Make all the adjustSize functions all the way till MemoryCache::adjustSize()
               take a signed long integer argument.

            2. Do not create a NativeImagePtr for an ImageFrame if its frameBytes plus the
               ImageFrameCache::decodedSize() will exceed the maximum of an unsigned integer.

            It is possible for Document::m_frame pointer to become stale
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161812
            <rdar://problem/27745023>

            Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

            Document::m_frame is supposed to get cleared by Document::prepareForDestruction().
            The Frame destructor calls Frame::setView(nullptr) which is supposed to call the
            prepareForDestruction() on the Frame's associated document. However,
            Frame::setView(nullptr) was calling prepareForDestruction() only if
            Document::inPageCache() returned true. This is because, we allow Documents to
            stay alive in the PageCache even though they don't have a frame.

            The issue is that Document::m_inPageCache flag was set to true right before
            firing the pagehide event, so technically before really entering PageCache.
            Therefore, we can run into problems if a Frame gets destroyed by a pagehide
            EventHandler because ~Frame() will not call Document::prepareForDestruction()
            due to Document::m_inPageCache being true. After the frame is destroyed,
            Document::m_frame becomes stale and any action on the document will likely
            lead to crashes (such as the one in the layout test and the radar which
            happens when trying to unregister event listeners from the document).

            The solution adopted in this patch is to replace the m_inPageCache boolean
            with a m_pageCacheState enumeration that has 3 states:
            - NotInPageCache
            - AboutToEnterPageCache
            - InPageCache

            Frame::setView() / Frame::setDocument() were then updated to call
            Document::prepareForDestruction() on the associated document whenever
            the document's pageCacheState is not InPageCache. This means that we
            will now call Document::prepareForDestruction() when the document is
            being detached from its frame while firing the pagehide event.

            Note that I tried to keep this patch minimal. Therefore, I kept
            the Document::inPageCache() getter for now. I plan to switch all its
            calls sites to the new Document::pageCacheState() getter in a follow-up
            patch so that we can finally drop the confusing Document::inPageCache().

        Make sure a page is still PageCache-able after firing the 'pagehide' events

        Make sure a page is still PageCache-able after firing the 'pagehide'
        events and abort if it isn't. This should improve robustness and it is
        easy for pagehide event handlers to do things that would make a Page no
        longer PageCache-able and this leads to bugs that are difficult to
        investigate.

        To achieve this, the 'pagehide' event firing logic was moved out of the
        CachedFrame constructor. It now happens earlier in
        PageCache::addIfCacheable() after checking if the page is cacheable and
        before constructing the CachedPage / CachedFrames. After firing the
        'pagehide' event in PageCache::addIfCacheable(), we check again that
        the page is still cacheable and we abort early if it is not.

        For this reason, we take care of re-incrementing the document's
        ignore-opens-during-unload in detachChildren(), which will take care of

            Elements should be inserted into a template element as its content's last child
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171373
            <rdar://problem/31862949>

            Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

            Before this change, our HTML parser obeys the following premises:
            1) A fostering child whose parent is a table should be inserted before its parent and under its grandparent.
            2) When inserting into a template element, an element should be inserted into its content.

            Let's walk through the example:
            a) Before eventhandler takes place
            template
            table
                svg <- parser
            b) After eventhandler takes place
            template
                table
                    svg <- parser
            c) after parsing svg
            template
                content
                    svg
                    (table)
                table

            Finally, in the example, the svg element will be inserted into the content of the template element while
            having its next sibling point to the table element. However, the table element is actually under the
            template element not its content.

            This messy tree is constructed because the second premise is incompleted. It should be: When inserting into
            a template element, an element should be inserted into its content as its last child.
            Quoted from Step 3 of https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#appropriate-place-for-inserting-a-node
            A correct tree will then looks like:
            template
                content
                    svg
                table

            When testing content extensions, we have always called an API function that internally
            has called AtomicString::init somewhere before we start compiling the content extension.
            On iOS, though, we call [_WKUserContentExtensionStore compileContentExtensionForIdentifier:...]
            without having already called anything that calls AtomicString::init.  The new CSS parser is now
            failing to parse some selectors because CSSSelectorParser::defaultNamespace is returning starAtom,
            which is a null atomic string before AtomicString::init is called.

            Covered by a new API test.

            we have to make sure that this special root linebox gets marked dirty when the associated floatbox changes.
            (Unfortunately through the recursive calls on dirtyLinesFromChangedChild(), we lose the information about

            Reduce the scope of code that should never dispatch DOM events so as to allow updating contents size
            after restoring a page from the page cache.

            In r214014 we instantiate a NoEventDispatchAssertion in FrameLoader::commitProvisionalLoad()
            around the call to CachedPage::restore() to assert when a DOM event is dispatched during
            page restoration as such events can cause re-entrancy into the page cache. As it turns out
            it is sufficient to ensure that no DOM events are dispatched after restoring all cached frames
            as opposed to after CachedPage::restore() returns.

            Also rename Document::enqueue{Pageshow, Popstate}Event() to dispatch{Pageshow, Popstate}Event(),
            respectively, since they synchronously dispatch events :(. We hope in the future to make them
            asynchronously dispatch events.

            The time channel attack can happen if the attacker applies FEColorMatrix

            floating point values. Performing floating-point operations on subnormals
            is very expensive unless the pixel in the source graphics is black (or
            zero). By measuring the time a filter takes to be applied, the attacker
            can know whether the pixel he wants to steal from  an iframe is black or
            white. By repeating the same process on all the pixels in the iframe, the
            attacker can reconstruct the whole page of the iframe.

            To fix this issue, the values in the matrices of these filters will clamped
            to FLT_MIN. We do not want to consume too much time calculating filtered
            pixels because of such tiny values. The difference between applying FLT_MIN
            and applying a subnormal should not be even noticeable. Normalizing the
            floating-point matrices should happen only at the beginning of the filter

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            When deconstructing the FrameTree, we fire the unload event in each subframe.
            Such unload event handler may insert a new frame, we would previously load
            such new frame which was unsafe as we would end up with an attached subframe
            on a detached tree. To address the issue, we prevent new subframes from loading
            while deconstructing the FrameTree and firing the unload events. This new
            behavior is consistent with Chrome and should therefore be safe from a
            compatibility standpoint.

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            When adding mask layers, there was an ordering dependency. There was a hack in GraphicsLayerCA::setVisibleAndCoverageRects()
            to propagate m_intersectsCoverageRect to masks. However, if GraphicsLayerCA::setVisibleAndCoverageRects()
            ran on the masked layer before the mask was added, nothing updated the "m_intersectsCoverageRect" state of the mask layer.

            Fix by explicitly calling setVisibleAndCoverageRects() on the mask layer, passing the same rects and
            viewport-constrained state as for its host layer (we already assume that their geometry matches).

            Follow-up to r211401. When passing around a reference to an object, the assumption is that
            the caller is retaining the underlying object. This breaks down for
            InbandDataTextTrack::removeDataCue(), which releases its own ownership of the cue object,
            then passes the reference to that object to its superclass to do further remove steps. The
            retain count of the cue can thus drop to zero within the scope of
            InbandTextTrack::removeCue(). Use "take" semantics to remove the cue from the
            m_incompleteCueMap without releasing ownership, and pass a reference to that retained object
            on to removeCue(), guaranteeing that the cue will not be destroyed until after the

            This patch brings the implementation of ComplexTextController in-line with the
            design at https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/ComplexTextController. Previously,
            ComplexTextController had a few problems:
            - The total width computed by ComplexTextController didn't match the width if
            you iterated over the entire string and added up the advances
            - FontCascade::getGlyphsAndAdvancesForComplexText() tried to compensate for
            the above by construing the concepts of paint advances as distinct from layout
            advances
            - Initial advances were considered part of layout sometimes and part of painting
            other times, depending on which function reports the information
            - For RTL runs, the wrong origin was added to the initial advance, and the origin
            should have been subtracted instead of added

            This patch exhaustively updates every function in ComplexTextController to be
            consistent with the design linked to above. This design solves all of these
            problems.

            layout advances, and the initial layout advance is already added into the
            m_adjustedBaseAdvances vector by adjustGlyphsAndAdvances(). Therefore, there is
            no need to add it again here.
            (WebCore::ComplexTextController::advance): This function had completely busted
            logic about the relationship between initial advances and the first origin in
            each run. Because of the fortunate choice of only representing layout advances
            in m_adjustedBaseAdvances, this entire block can be removed and the raw paint
            initial advance can be reported to the GlyphBuffer. Later in the function, we
            have to update the logic about how to compute a paint advance given a layout
            advance and some origins. In particular, there are two tricky pieces here: 1.
            The layout advance for the first glyph is equal to (initial advance - first
            origin + first Core Text advance, so computing the paint offset must cancel out
            the initial layout offset, and 2. the last paint advance in a run must actually
            end up at the position of the first glyph in the next run, so the next run's
            initial advance must be queried.
            (WebCore::ComplexTextController::adjustGlyphsAndAdvances): Previously, we
            represented an initial advance of a successive run by just adding it to the
            previous run's last advance. However, this is incompatible with the new model
            presented in the link above, so we remove this section. We also have to add in
            the logic that the layout advance for the first glyph is equal to the formula
            presented above.

            Upon destruction of a Page, we destroy the BackForwardClient, which is supposed
            to keep track of HistoryItems associated to this particular page and remove them
            from the PageCache. Given the crash trace, the issue seems to be that some
            HistoryItems associated with the Page sometimes linger in the PageCache *after*
            the Page has been destroyed, which leads to crashes later on when pruning the
            PageCache.

            In order to make the process more robust, this patch refactors the code so that
            the Page is now in charge of removing all its associated HistoryItems from the
            PageCache instead of relying on the BackForwardClient. Also, instead of having
            the Page keep track of which HistoryItems are associated with it (which is
            error prone), we now scan all PageCache entries instead to find which ones are
            associated with the Page. While this is in theory slower, this is much safer
            and in practice not an issue because the PageCache usually has 3-5 entries.

            Crash under DOMSelection::deleteFromDocument()
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167232

            Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

            The crash was caused by DOMSelection's deleteFromDocument() mutating contents inside the user-agent
            shadow tree of an input element when the text field is readonly. Fixed the bug by exiting early
            whenever the selection is inside a shadow tree since getSelection().getRangeAt(0) always returns
            a range outside the input element or any shadow tree for that matter.

            New behavior matches that of Gecko. The working draft spec of which I'm the editor states that
            deleteFromDocument() must invoke Range's deleteContents() on the associated range, which is
            the collapsed range returned by getSelection().getRangeAt(0) in the spec:
            https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-selection-api-20160921/#widl-Selection-deleteFromDocument-void
            And Range's deleteContents() immediately terminates in step 1 when start and end are identical:
            https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/6b7621282c2e3b222ac585650e484abf4c0a416b/

            Note that Range's DOM mutating methods are not available inside an user-agent shadow tree because
            WebKit never returns a Range whose end boundary points are inside the tree to author scripts.
            Editing commands (ones executable from document.execCommand) that mutate DOM like this check whether
            the content is editable or not. Since VisibleSelection's validate() function makes sure the selection
            is either entirely within or outside of an root editable element (editing host in the W3C spec lingo),
            editing commands should never mutate a random node inside an user-agent shadow tree.

        Add null checking of the FrameView in Document::destroyRenderTree() before
        calling functions on it. This is not necessary in trunk, as the FrameView
        is guaranteed to be present there.

        FrameView can be missing on the branch, since render trees for page cached documents
        are destroyed when leaving the page cache, not when entering it (trunk behavior.)
        When leaving the page cache, the FrameView is already detached, hence the bug.

            Make sure that we always clean up the DOM window when clearing Window properties, even if the document will
            remain in the page cache. Since 'clearWindowShell' is only used in FrameLoader, divide it's beahvior into
            two steps:
        
            1. Rename 'clearWindowShell' to 'clearWIndowShellsNotMatchingDOMWindow' to better describe its function.
            Switch to a modern C++ loop. Do not switch to the new DOMWindow here, but detach and clear existing
            DOMWindow connections.

            2. Add a new method 'setDOMWindowForWindowShell'. Complete switch to the new DOMWindow.

            This change allows us to disconnect the old DOMWindow, perform the 'setDocument(nullptr)' operation, and then
            connect to the new Window without leaving the loader in an inconsistent state.

            so we want to match behavior of our CFURLConnection code here.

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            Changeset r200971 added code to ensure that layout is up-to-date before hit testing, but did
            so only for the main frame. It was still possible to enter cross-frame hit testing with a
            subframe needing style recalc. In that situation, the subframe's updateLayout() would get
            called, which could trigger a compositing change that marked the parent frame as needing style
            recalc. A subsequent layout on the parent frame (for example by hit testing traversing into
            a second subframe) could then mutate the parent frame's layer tree while hit testing was
            traversing it.

            This patch modifies the hit test logic to ensure that a recursive layout is performed so that
            we always perform hit tests on a clean set of frames. It also adds some assertions to warn
            us if we encounter this invalid state.

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            During the tokenization process of an HTML tag the start and end positions of each of its
            attributes is tracked so that the XSS Auditor can request a snippet around a suspected
            injected attribute. We need to take care to consider document.write() boundaries when
            tracking the start and end positions of each HTML tag and attribute so that the XSS Auditor
            receives the correct snippet. Following r178265 we no longer consider document.write()
            boundaries when tracking the start and end positions of attributes. So, the substring
            represented by the start and end positions of an attribute may correspond to some other
            attribute in the tag. Therefore the XSS Auditor may fail to block an injection because the
            snippet it requested may not be the snippet that it intended to request.

            [MSE][Mac] In SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC::abort(), support reseting parser to the last appended initialization segment.
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135164

            Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

            Test: media/media-source/media-source-abort-resets-parser.html

            Use the -[AVStreamDataParser appendStreamData:withFlags:] to implement "resetting" the parser. In this case,
            the parser isn't explicitly reset during resetParserState(), but rather a flag is set so that the next append
            signals a data discontinuity, and the parser is reset at that point.

            Because a previous append operation may be in-flight during this abort(), care must be taken to invalidate any
            operations which may have already started on a background thread. So SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC will use a
            separate WeakPtrFactory for its append operations, will invalidate any outstanding WeakPtrs during an abort(),
            and will block until the previous append() operation completes.

            This will require the WebAVStreamDataParserListener object to occasionally have it's WeakPtr pointing back to the
            SourceBufferPrivateAVFObjC to be reset after an abort(), so make that ivar an @property. Rather than passing a
            RetainPtr to itself in all the callbacks it handles, the WebAVStreamDataParserListener can just pass in a copy
            of its own WeakPtr (which may be invalidated during an abort()).

            Break the distinct operations of "abort()" and "resetParserState()" into their own methods in SourceBufferPrivate
            and all its subclasses.

            Seeking video doesn't update seek position
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162575
            <rdar://problem/28457219>

            Reviewed by Jer Noble.

            On ToT, seeking in a video causes the playhead to stutter, and does not actually update media remote's seek
            position. This is partly due to how we do not update media remote with new information when beginning to respond
            to remote seek commands, so media remote continues to think that a playing video is still playing despite the
            user attempting to seek through it.

            To fix this, we introduce timer-based guards around remote seek commands, such that a seek "gesture" begins when
            we receive the first seek command and ends when no seek command has been received in a set amount of time (this
            is 0.5 seconds, which is approximately what other clients around the platform use).

            Also, when responding to a remote seek, perform the seek with no tolerance. This prevents the playhead from
            stuttering at the end of a seek from the final requested destination of the seek to the last actually seeked
            time in the video.

            When beginning to seek, we must pause the media. Through existing mechanisms, this causes the media session
            manager to update its Now Playing information, which informs media remote that we are no longer playing and
            prevents us from stuttering. However, when ending a seek, we must also trigger an additional update to again
            refresh media remote's view of the current time. This prevents a flicker when playing media after seeking.

            Unit tests to be added in a follow-up due to time constraints.

            Certain elements (for example, iframe elements) can instantiate further

            context P has a Document D with an element E that nests another browsing 
            context C inside it, then C is said to be nested through D, and E is said to 
            be the browsing context container of C. If the browsing context container 
            element E is in the Document D, then P is said to be the parent browsing 
            context of C and C is said to be a child browsing context of P. Otherwise,

        Reviewed by Geoff Garen.

        All uses of hasStaticPropertyTable flag generated by bindings are wrong.

        JSLocation::putDelegate checks the static property table redundantly.

        In the case of same origin access, if the property is not in the static
        table the method will call JSObject::put and return true (indicating the
        delegate handled the put). If the property is in the static table, the
        method will return false (indicating the the delegate did not handle the
        access) - in which case the calling function will call JSObject::put.
        Checking for the property in the static table is redundant - same origin
        access does not require any special handling, and should just always
        return false & let the caller handle the put.

        In the case of cross origin access, if the property is not in the static
        table we return true (indicating the access was handled, and silently
        blocking it). If it is a static property, we check the name, and if the
        name is not 'href' we also return true, silently blocking. In the case
        that the name is 'href' we'll return false, indicating to the caller
        that the access was not handled by the delegate, resulting in it taking
        place. The additional check of the static table is redundant, since we
        only have special behaviour in the case of 'href'. (Moreover it is
        unnecesszarily fragile, since if we made a change such that 'href' was no
        longer implemented as a static property with would fail.)

        - for same origin, always return false.
        - for cross origin, return false for 'href', otherwise return true.

        ImageDocuments leak their world.
        <https://webkit.org/b/155167>
        <rdar://problem/24987363>

        Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

        ImageDocument uses a special code path in ImageLoader in order to manually
        control how the image is loaded. It has to do this because the ImageDocument
        is really just a synthetic wrapper around a main resource that's an image.

        This custom loading code had a bug where it would create a new CachedImage
        and neglect to set its CachedResource::m_state flag to Pending (which is
        normally set by CachedResource::load(), but we don't call that for these.)

        This meant that when ImageDocument called CachedImage::finishLoading() to
        trigger the notifyFinished() callback path, the image would look at its
        loading state and see that it was Unknown (not Pending), and conclude that
        it hadn't loaded yet. So we never got the notifyFinished() signal.

        The world leaks here because ImageLoader slaps a ref on its <img> element
        while it waits for the loading operation to complete. Once finished, whether
        successfully or with an error, it derefs the <img>.

        Since we never fired notifyFinished(), we ended up with an extra ref on
        these <img> forever, and then the element kept its document alive too.

        Sporadic crash in HashTableAddResult following CSSValuePool::createFontFamilyValue
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158297

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        In an effort to reduce the flash of unstyled content, we force all elements
        to have display: none during an external stylesheet load. We do this by
        ignoring the CSS cascade and forcing all elements to have a placeholder style
        which hardcodes display: none. (This is necessary to make elements created by
        script during the stylesheet load not flash.)

        This style is exposed to web content via getComputedStyle(), which means it
        needs to maintain the invariant that font-families can never be null strings.
        We enforce this by forcing the font-family to be the standard font name.

        Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

        We already had most of the infrastructure for dotted / dashed underlines.
        Previously, we were setting the stroke style for the underlines, but then
        filling the underlines (which means the stroke styles is irrelevant).
        Instead, we should just compute the individual dots / dashes to fill.

        The implementation of this is done inside GraphicsContext because
        GraphicsContext is already responsible for handling the single / double
        underline distinction. Extending it to be responsible for dotted / dashed
        is the natural thing to do.

            Garbage is displayed when root svg element has mix-blend-mode set
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150556

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            This bug happens when compositing on a CALayer and drawing on a transparent
            layer, so it happens with WK2 with <svg style="mix-blend-mode...">. And it
            can happen with WK1 also with <svg style="opacity=...;mix-blend-mode...">.
            But in both cases, the SVG root renderer should be the root of the render
            tree. So it happens only with the stand alone SVG documents.

            SVGRenderContext::prepareToRenderSVGContent() ignores the opacity of
            the SVG root but it creates a transparent layer for the blend-mode.

            But RenderLayer::beginTransparencyLayers() creates a transparent layer
            for opacity and it sets the blend-mode also.

            The fix is to begin two transparent layers for the SVG root renderer: one
            for the opacity and the second for the blend-mode. The opacity transparent
            layer will be still managed by RenderLayer::beginTransparencyLayers(). While
            the blend-mode transparent layer will be managed by SVGRenderContext
            ::prepareToRenderSVGContent().

            Calls to setIntegralAttribute triggers event handling code, which can cause
            the underlying m_frameOwnerElement member to be deleted. We could clone this
            object, but since we only want the width and height we should just read them
            while we know the object is in a good state, then execute the potentially
            mutating methods.

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            The issue is that FormSubmission::create() was iterating over
            form.associatedElements() as was calling Element::appendFormData()
            in the loop. HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() was calling
            pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::Load) which causes a synchronous
            layout and can fire events (such as focus event) synchronously.
            Firing those events synchronously allows the JS to modify the
            form.associatedElements() vector we are currently iterating on.

            To avoid this issue, we now call pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::DoNotLoad)
            in HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() as we are not allowed to fire
            synchronous events at this point. I also added a security assertion
            in FormSubmission::create() to catch cases where we fire JS events
            while iterating over the form associated elements to more easily
            notice these things in the future.

            Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

            Composite fonts were first introduced in [1]. These composite fonts are extremely rare
            because:
            1. None of the preinstalled fonts on either OS X nor iOS are composite fonts,
            2. WebKit does not support loading web fonts from composite font files, and
            3. WebKit's support only ever existed on OS X (none of the other ports).

            In fact, no one I've consulted with has ever seen any of these fonts used in the wild.
            The fonts also require a fundamentally broken code path, and add complexity to WebKit.

            Re-enable synchronous popstate event for safari-601-branch
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153297
            rdar://problem/24154417

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            r192369 made the popstate event dispatch asynchronously, which matches what the HTML5 spec says to do.
            However, due to compatibility regressions, we do not want to include this behavior change in
            safari-601-branch. This change reverts r192369's changes to Document.cpp, but retains the new tests.
            This change is intended only for safari-601-branch and its copies. The popstate event should remain
            asynchronous in trunk.

            Firing popstate synchronously makes both fast/loader/remove-iframe-during-history-navigation-different.
            Html and fast/loader/remove-iframe-during-history-navigation-same.html crash, because their onpopstate
            handlers remove frames from the document that will later be accessed by
            HistoryController::recursiveGoToItem().

            To prevent the crashes, this change does two things:
            1. Keep a reference to the current frame inside FrameLoader::loadSameDocumentItem(), since calling
               loadInSameDocument() might otherwise delete it.
            2. Handle a null frame when iterating a HistoryItem's child frames in
               HistoryController::recursiveGoToItem(), since calling goToItem() on one frame might cause another
               frame to be deleted.

            Covered by existing tests. fast/loader/stateobjects/popstate-is-asynchronous-expected.txt was updated
            to expect popstate to be synchronous.

            GlyphPage::fill() has multiple code paths to accomplish its goal. It uses the shouldUseCoreText() helper
            function to determine which one of the paths should be taken. However, not all of the code paths in
            GlyphPage::fill() are able of handling all situations. Indeed, the CoreText code paths in GlyphPage::fill()
            are only able to handle the situations which shouldUseCoreText() returns true for. This happens in the
            following cases:

            1. If the font is a composite font
            2. If the font is used for text-combine
            3. If the font has vertical glyphs

            In r187693, I added one more case to this list: If the font is the system font. However, I failed to add
            the necessary support to GlyphPage::fill() for this case. Becasue of this, we just happened to fall into
            the case of vertical fonts (just by coincidence), which causes us to use
            CTFontGetVerticalGlyphsForCharacters() instead of CTFontGetGlyphsForCharacters().

            The solution is to adopt the same behavior we were using before r187693. Back then, we were using
            CGFontGetGlyphsForUnichars(), which always returned horizontal glyphs. We should simply adopt this same
            behavior, except in the Core Text case. Therefore, this patch is just a simple check to see if we are
            using the system font when determining which Core Text function to use.

            In order to perform font fallback, we must know which fonts support which characters. We
            perform this check by asking each font to map a sequence of codepoints to glyphs, and
            any glyphs which end up with a 0 value are unsupported by the font.

            One of the mechanisms that we use to do this is to combine the code points into a string,
            and tell Core Text to lay out the string. However, this is fundamentally a different
            operation than the one we are trying to perform. Strings combine adjacent codepoints into
            grapheme clusters, and CoreText operates on these. However, we are trying to gain
            information regarding codepoints, not grapheme clusters.

            Instead of taking this string-based approach, we should try harder to use Core Text
            functions which operate on ordered collections of characters, rather than strings. In
            particular, CTFontGetGlyphsForCharacters() and CTFontGetVerticalGlyphsForCharacters()
            have the behavior we want where any unmapped characters end up with a 0 value glyph.

            Previously, we were only using the result of those functions if they were successfully
            able to map their entire input. However, given the fact that we can degrade gracefully
            in the case of a partial mapping, we shouldn't need to bail completely to the
            string-based approach should a partial mapping occur.

            At some point we should delete the string-based approach entirely. However, this path
            is still explicitly used for composite fonts. Fixing that use case is out of scope
            for this patch.

                Reviewed by Brian Burg.

                Test: http/tests/inspector/console/cross-domain-inspected-node-access.html

                The inspector backend injects the CommandLineAPI Source with a
                corresponding CommandLineAPIHost into each execution context
                created by the page (main frame, sub frames, etc).

                When creating the JSValue wrapper for the CommandLineAPIHost using
                the generated toJS(...) DOM bindings, we were using the cached
                CommandLineAPIHost wrapper values in the single DOMWrapperWorld shared
                across all frames. This meant that the first time the wrapper was
                needed it was created in context A. But when needed for context B
                it was using the wrapper created in context A. Using this wrapper
                in context B was producing unexpected cross-origin warnings.

                The solution taken here, is to create a new JSValue wrapper for
                the CommandLineAPIHost per execution context. This way each time
                the CommandLineAPIHost wrapper is used in a frame, it is using
                the one created for that frame.

                The C++ host object being wrapped has a lifetime equivalent to
                the Page. It does not change in this patch. The wrapper values
                are cleared on page navigation or when the page is closed, and
                will be garbage collected.

            rdar://problem/23886181

            Reviewed by Tim Horton.

            r154382 added code that modifies parentLayer traversal, looking for ancestor
            scrollable layers. However, it confusingly added another code path in which
            the ancestor layer traversal cross a frame boundary, when RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible()
            already has one. I fixed this new location to adjust the rect coordinates in r187593,
            but then code that hit both crossing points double-mapped the coordinates, causing
            autoscroll jumping.

            Fix by reverting r154382 and r187593, going back to doing the ancestor walk in
            one place. Re-fix r154382 by implementing RenderLayer::allowsCurrentScroll(),
            which contains the logic for line clamp, autoscroll and ensuring that overflow:hidden
            can be programmatically scrolled.

            Form controls are special; they can have overflow:hidden but still be user-scrollable
            during autoscroll; this is handled via the confusingly-named canBeProgramaticallyScrolled().
            RenderTextControlSingleLine implements this to ensure that readonly text inputs
            autoscroll (which is exercised by a test).

            The frame-to-parent-frame rect mapping in RenderLayer::scrollRectToVisible() is
            fixed to use the coordinate mapping functions from Widget/ScrollView, with the
            addition of a new utility function contentsToContainingViewContents().

            A "Scrolling" logging channel is added with a few log points.

            font-variant-caps does not work if the font does not support font features
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149774

            Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

            This test implements synthesis for small-caps and all-small-caps. It does so by
            moving font variant selection into a higher level (ComplexTextController).
            In general, the approach is to use the pure font feature until we encounter
            a character which needs to be uppercased, and which the font feature does not
            support uppercasing. In this situation, we try again with synthesis. In this
            case, synthesis means artificially uppercasing letters and rendering them with
            a smaller font.

            We require system support to know which glyphs a particular font feature supports.
            Therefore, on operating systems which do not include this support, we will simply
            say that the font feature does not support any glyphs.

            [Content Filtering] Crash in DocumentLoader::notifyFinished() when allowing a media document to load

            When the main resource of a media document commits, WebKit cancels its load since the plug-in or media engine
            will do its own loading. If content filtering is enabled, and the filter waits allow the load until the entire
            resource is downloaded, then ContentFilter will attempt to call DocumentLoader::notifyFinished() immediately
            after delivering the buffered resource data to DocumentLoader. However, delivering the data will have nulled out
            DocumentLoader's m_mainResource when the load was cancelled, leading to a crash in notifyFinished().

            To resolve this, add a new Stopped state to ContentFilter. Set this state if DocumentLoader clears its main
            resource or detaches from its frame. If ContentFilter is in the Stopped state after calling
            DocumentLoader::dataReceived(), do not proceed to call DocumentLoader::notifyFinished().

            Don't fire popstate event on initial document load

            According to the specification [1], a popstate event should only be fired
            when the document has a "last entry" and the entry being navigated to isn't
            it.  A document is created without a "last entry" and gets one just after
            this check when it is first navigated to, so a popstate should be fired any
            time a document is navigated to except for the first time after it has been
            created.

            Exploitable crash happens when an SVG contains an indirect resource inheritance cycle
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150203

            Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

            Detecting cycles in SVG resource references happens in two places.
            1. In SVGResourcesCycleSolver::resolveCycles() which it is called from 
               SVGResourcesCache::addResourcesFromRenderer(). When a cycle is deleted,
               SVGResourcesCycleSolver::breakCycle() is called to break the link. In
               the case of a cyclic resource inheritance, SVGResources::resetLinkedResource()
               is called to break this cycle.
            2. SVGPatternElement::collectPatternAttributes() which is called from
               RenderSVGResourcePattern::buildPattern(). The purpose is to resolve
               the pattern attributes and to build a tile image which can be used to
               fill the SVG element renderer. Detecting the cyclic resource reference
               in this function is not sufficient and can detect simple cycles like
                <pattern id="a" xlink:href="#b"/>
                <pattern id="b" xlink:href="#a"/>.
               But it does not detect cycles like:
                <pattern id="a">
                    <rect fill="url(#b)"/>
                </pattern>
                <pattern id="b" xlink:href="#a"/>.

            The fix is to get rid of SVGPatternElement::collectPatternAttributes() which
            uses SVGURIReference::targetElementFromIRIString() to navigates through the
            referenced resource elements and tries to detect cycles. Instead we can
            implement RenderSVGResourcePattern::collectPatternAttributes() which calls
            SVGResourcesCache::cachedResourcesForRenderer() to get the SVGResources
            of the pattern. Then we use SVGResources::linkedResource() to navigate the
            resource inheritance tree. The cached SVGResources is guaranteed to be free
            of cycles.

            The FrameSelection::setSelection method sometimes releases the last reference to a frame.
            When this happens, the Element::updateFocusAppearance would attempt to use dereferenced memory.
            Instead, we should ensure that the Frame lifetime is guaranteed to extend through the duration
            of the method call.

        Stop honoring the user default "WebKitKerningAndLigaturesEnabledByDefault"

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        This user default is currently on by default. Therefore, by setting the user default,
        users can only disable kerning / ligatures (rather than enable it).

        There are a few reasons why we should stop honoring it:

        1. In the brave new world of font-feature-settings and font-variant-ligatures, there
        are many different kinds of ligatures which may be enabled at will. The simplistic
        statement of "turn on ligatures" no longer has any meaning.

        2. If a user wants to disable kerning / ligatures, he/she can do it with a user
        stylesheet.

        3. The default isn't able to be tested with DumpRenderTree or WebKitTestRunner.

        4. I have never heard of anyone actually using this user default.

        According to the CSS Fonts Level 3 spec, web authors are allowed to put

        This patch gives a FontFeatureSettings object and a FontVariantSettings
        object to CSSFontFace, and moves common parsing logic from
        StyleBuilderCustom to a shared location. Then, once the two properties

        FontCascade::typesettingFeatures() is not privy to font-variant-* nor font-feature-settings
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149775

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch has two pieces:

        We used to have a boolean, enableLigatures, which affected how we perform shaping in both our
        simple and complex text codepaths. However, in this brave new world of font-feature-settings
        and font-variant-*, there are many properties which may affect shaping (and multiple kinds
        of ligatures). This patch renames this boolean to requiresShaping, and teaches it about all
        the various properties which affect text shaping.

        Similarly, one of the places which used this enableLigatures boolean was to tell CoreText
        if it should disable ligatures. However, we now have much finer-grained control over
        ligatures during font creation. This patch moves the responsibility of dictating which
        font features should be enabled entirely to the Font. Therefore, getCFStringAttributes()
        doesn't know anything about ligatures anymore; the logic inside font creation is used
        instead.

        An added benefit of moving all the font feature logic to one place is that we can implement
        the feature resolution algorithm described in the CSS3 fonts spec. This patch adds a test to
        makes sure that text-rendering, font-feature-settings, and font-variant-* play together
        nicely.

        Split TypesettingFeatures into kerning and ligatures bools
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150074

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Our TypesettingFeatures type represents whether kerning or ligatures are enabled
        when laying out text. However, now that I have implemented font-feature-settings
        and font-variant-*, this type is wildly inadequate. There are now multiple kinds
        of ligatures, and many other features which are neither kerning nor ligatures.
        Adding tons of information to this type doesn't make sense because 1) We already
        have a FontVariantSettings struct which contains this information, and 2) None
        of the users of TypesettingFeatures care about most of these new features.

        In this new world of font features, the font-kerning property isn't changing.
        Therefore, all the code which relies only on the Kerning value in
        TypesettingFeatures doesn't need to change. The places which rely on Ligatures,
        however, need to be updated to understand that there are many different kinds
        of ligatures.

        Indeed, after inspection, all of the places which inspect ligatures are more
        interested in a high-level concept of whether or not we can trust some simple
        computation. Therefore, we really have two things we care about: Kerning, and
        this high-level concept.

        This patch is the second step to update our view of the world to include
        font-feature-settings and font-variant-*. In particular, this patch simply
        splits TypesettingFeatures into two Booleans, one for Kerning, and one for
        Ligatures (which has no behavior change). Then, once they are separated, I can
        migrate the Ligatures Boolean to take on its new meaning.

        This change is purely mechanical.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        Crash in MemoryCache::pruneDeadResourcesToSize()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151833
        <rdar://problem/22392235>

        Reviewed by David Kilzer.

        MemoryCache::pruneDeadResourcesToSize() is iterating over m_allResources
        (which is a vector of LRUList). It first destroys decoded data for each
        resource in the LRUList. Then, if it does not suffice to reach the
        target size, and starts actually removing resources from the cache.

        The issue is that this code alters m_allResources (and its LRULists) as
        it is iterating over it. We tried to deal with this in various ways:
        1. Increment the iterator before removing the resource pointed by the
          iterator.
        2. Protect the next resource in the LRUList and abort early if it is no
          longer in the cache.

        This adds code complexity and apparently does not correctly handle all
        the edge cases as we still see crashes in this code. In particular, I
        suspect that 2. may not be sufficient if it is possible for the next
        resource to be moved to another LRUList (in which case, next->inCache()
        would still return true but the iterator would however become invalid).

        To make the code simpler and more robust, this patch copies the LRUList
        (and refs the CachedResources) before iterating over it. This is a lot
        safer and should hopefully fix the crashes we see in this function.

        No new tests, no reproduction case.

            CSSSegmentedFontFace::fontRanges() does not handle duplicate fonts correctly
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147765

            Reviewed by Filip Pizlo.

            CSSSegmentedFontFace::fontRanges() was trying to hash on FontDescriptors by
            picking a few specific pieces of data out of the FontDescriptor, computing
            a hash on it, and using that unsigned as a key in a HashMap. This has two
            problems: it doesn't handle equality correctly, as hash collisions cannot
            depend on an equality operator to dedup, and it doesn't hash on all the
            members of a FontDescription.

            Instead, this HashMap should use FontDescriptionKey, which represents a
            FontDescription, and is designed exactly for the purpose of being used as a
            key in a HashMap.

            No new tests because there is no behavior change (because a problem occurs
            when two different FontDescriptions hash to the same value, which is rare).

        [Cocoa] [Font Features] Implement font-variant-*
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148413

        Reviewed by Darin Adler.

        This patch is the first pass of implementing of the font-variant-* properties. Specifically,
        these properties are:
        font-variant-ligatures
        font-variant-position
        font-variant-caps
        font-variant-numeric
        font-variant-alternates
        font-variant-east-asian

        These new properties are held inside FontDescription as bit fields. At font creation time,
        we consult with the FontDescription to figure out which variants are specified. We then
        convert those variants to font features, and resolve these font features with the additional
        features specified by font-feature-settings (as the spec requires). This patch also makes
        our caches sensitive to these new properties of FontDescription so we don't look up cached,
        stale fonts.

        The implementation has some caveats, however. They are listed here:
        1. These new properties need to interact correctly with @font-face declarations. In
        particular, only certain properties of the FontDescription should be considered when
        detecting if a @font-face declaration applies to a particular element. This discrimination
        does not happen correctly. In addition, any feature-specific CSS properties inside the
        @font-face declaration need to be consulted at a particular point during the feature
        resolve. This does not currently occur.
        2. One of the properties, font-variant-alternates, has a few values which require custom
        CSS functions, which makes modeling the properties as bit fields tricky. These extra values
        need to be implemented. This patch implements all the values which do not require extra CSS
        features.
        3. These new properties have a shorthand, font-variant, which is designed to be backward-
        compatible with CSS 2.1's concept of font-variant. In particular, CSS 2.1 allows you to use
        "normal" and "small-caps" with font-variant. Both of these values are values of the new
        property font-variant-caps. However, our existing implementation of small-caps does not
        use font features when they exist; instead, it simply draws text at a smaller font size and
        uses (effectively) text-transform to force capital letters. This implementation needs to be
        unified with the new font-variant-caps property so that we can expand font-variant to be
        a shorthand for the new properties.
        4. font-variant-position and font-variant-caps should provide appropriate synthesis if no
        matching font-feature exists.
        5. FontCascade::typesettingFeatures() is now no-longer accurate. Fixing this would be large
        enough to warrant its own patch.
        6. These properties are not tested with TrueType fonts.

        Clean up makeFontCascadeCacheKey()
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147430

        Reviewed by Benjamin Poulain.

        FontDescriptionKey is designed to encapsulate all the cacheable properties of a FontDescription.
        However, a higher-level cache, FontCascadeCacheKey, was taking some values from FontDescriptions.
        The fact that there wasn't a bug before is just a happy coincidence. This patch moves those bits
        from the higher-level cache and puts them into FontDescriptionKey where they belong.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

        Make FontDescriptionKey sensitive to FontFeatureSettings
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147751

        Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

        Just like how FontDescription hashes should be sensitive to locale, they should
        also be sensitive to font features.

        This patch also fixes operator== for FontDescriptionKey, which was previously
        comparing hashes for equality instead of the underlying data. Comparing hashes
        for equality is useless inside hashmaps.

        This is in preparation for implementing font-feature-settings.

        No new tests because there is no behavior change.

            Adopt AVContentKeySession

            Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

            Adopt a new API for managing key state, AVContentKeySession. Because this necessitates a change
            in both the initialization data returned by the needkey event, and passed into the createSession()
            method, bump the protocol version number (to 3), and keep supporting the old key management API
            for legacy content.

            To do so, move most of the implementation of CDMPrivateMediaSourceAVFObjC into a new subclass,
            CDMSessionAVStreamSession, and add a new subclass, CDMSessionAVContentKeySession, to support the
            new API.

            (WebCore::CSSParser::parseCustomPropertyDeclaration):
            At the parser level, "revert" is just like inherit/initial/unset and gets its own special
            singleton value, CSSRevertValue.

            but patching it anyway.

            * css/SelectorChecker.h:
            Add a MatchDefault value of 0 to the LinkMatchMask. This enables it to be used as an index
            to the correct value in Property (in the style resolution code).

            * css/StyleResolver.cpp:
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::State::initForStyleResolve):
            Delete any lingering old CascadedProperty rollbacks for UA/user rules.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::styleForKeyframe):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::styleForPage):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::applyMatchedProperties):
            Pass along the MatchResult as an additional parameter, since we need it to lazily compute
            the cascade rollbacks if the "revert" keyword is encountered.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::cascadedPropertiesForRollback):
            This method will lazily create and return a new CascadedProperties pointer that is cached
            in the StyleResolver's state. This will contain only UA rules (for user reverts) and UA/user
            rules (for author reverts). These will only be computed at most once for a given element
            when doing a reversion, and they will be computed lazily, i.e., only if a revert is
            requested.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::applyProperty):
            Pass along the LinkMatchMask and the MatchResult to applyProperty. This way we know specifically
            which link type we were computing if we have to revert (so that we roll back and look at the
            same index in the reverted version). The MatchResult is passed along because it is needed
            to build the CascadedProperties rollbacks.

            The basic idea is that if a revert is encountered, the level that the rule came from is
            checked. If it is UA level, just treat as "unset." If it is author or user level, get
            the correct CascadedProperties rollback and repeat the applyProperty using the property
            found in the rollback. If the property is not present in the cascade rollback, then the
            revert becomes an unset.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::hasCustomProperty):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::customProperty):
            Helpers used by applyProperty to check on custom properties, since they can revert too
            just like a regular property can.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::setPropertyInternal):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::set):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::setDeferred):
            Passing along the CascadeLevel (UA, User, Author) so that it can be stored in the Property.
            This way when we do property application, we always know where the rule came from so
            that the reversion can be handled properly.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::addStyleProperties):
            (WebCore::cascadeLevelForIndex):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::addMatches):
            When style properties are added, also figure out the CascadeLevel and pass it along to be
            stored in the Property. We use the MatchResult's ranges to know where a property comes from.

            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::applyDeferredProperties):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::CascadedProperties::Property::apply):
            (WebCore::StyleResolver::applyCascadedProperties):

            "all" for animations is a special value and should not be confused with the property. It

            * css/CSSPropertyNames.in:
            Add the "all" property to the list and use a special keyword in the Longhands value, "all",

            will-change should trigger stacking context based purely on properties
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148068

            Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.

            Previously, our will-change implementation didn't trigger stacking context
            on an inline if the will-change property didn't apply to inlines (like 'transform').
            However, this doesn't agree with the CSS-WG consensus (https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Sep/0112.html).

            Change behavior to have stacking context creation behavior for will-change be
            identical for inlines and blocks.

            Take CSSPropertyWebkitBackfaceVisibility out of the list of properties that causes
            will-change to create stacking context, since no value of the property creates
            stacking.

            Move willChangeCreatesStackingContext() and shouldWillChangeCreateStackingContext()

            Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

            Fonts with features are simply modeled as new font objects. Font
            feature information is contained within FontDescription, and our
            caches are correctly sensitive to this information. Therefore,
            we just need to make our font lookup code honor the request to
            use certain features.

            This patch creates a file, FontCacheCoreText.cpp, which will be the
            new home of all shared OS X / iOS FontCache code. Over time, I will
            be moving more and more source into this file, until there is
            nothing left of FontCacheMac.mm and FontCacheIOS.mm. For now, the
            only function in this file is the code which applies font features.

            Web Inspector: yank/kill shortcuts (CTRL+Y, K) don't work in Console / QuickConsole
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=151157

            Reviewed by Joseph Pecoraro.

            CodeMirror maintains its own editor buffer and implements its own
            `killLine` command but doesn't implement the yank command. So, text
            that is "killed" with CTRL-k inside a CodeMirror instance isn't
            added to Editor's kill ring. Subsequent yank commands won't match
            up with the killed text, instead returning text from a prior kill
            that was handled by Editor (i.e., in a contenteditable or form input).

            This patch adds a host function so that the Inspector frontend can
            append "missed" killed text to Editor's kill ring. Subsequent
            yanks handled by Editor will then match the text killed by CodeMirror.

            No new tests, because we need to use both InspectorFrontendHost
            and TestRunner.execCommand, but the latter is not available in
            the inspector context where we would need to simulate a kill.

                Added. This appends the killed text to the kill ring, starting

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            Over 11 years ago, someone was in a big hurry to fix a bunch
            of emacs keybindings bugs, and accidentally regressed the kill ring
            behavior for backwards-delete-word. It should prepend to the beginning.

            This patch fixes the regression and cleans up the kill ring-related
            code in Editor and commands. It also adds some tests to cover the
            regressed code a bit better.

                It turns out that the native API implicitly clears the kill sequence when

                to prevent this behavior from happening.

            Since the tree scope is set to that of Document's inside removeBetween when a node is removed from a shadow tree,
            oldScope != &treeScope() was already true inside Element::removedFrom. This can introduce an inconsistency in
            DocumentOrderedMap which could result in a crash. Fixed the bug by checking it against document(), which is the
            behavior we had prior to r150187.

            Crash when font completes downloading after calling 2D canvas setText() multiple times
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148789

            Reviewed by Darin Adler.

            The CSSFontSelector has a list of clients, and when fonts complete downloading, these
            clients get a call back. CanvasRenderingContext2D::State is one such of these clients. However,
            the CSSFontSelector may be destroyed and recreated at any time. We were getting into a case
            where multiple CSSFontSelectors were thinking that the same CanvasRenderingContext2D::State were
            their client. When the CanvasRenderingContext2D::State was destroyed, it only unregistered
            itself from one of the CSSFontSelectors, which means the CSSFontSelector left over has a dangling
            pointer to it.

            The solution is to implement a new helper class, FontProxy, to hold the
            CanvasRenderingContext2D::State's font, and maintain the invariant that this object is always
            registered to exactly one CSSFontSelector, and this CSSFontSelector is the one which is associated
            with the FontProxy's FontCascade object. This patch maintains this invariant, as well as protecting
            all access to the State's FontCascade object so no one can reach in and change it without going
            through functions which maintain the invariant.

            [Content Filtering] Determine navigation and content policy before continuing to filter a load
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148506

            Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

            Prior to this change, ContentFilter would hide from DocumentLoader all CachedRawResourceClient callbacks until
            a decision was made, then replay the missed callbacks. This approach interacted poorly with some features of
            the loader, notably appcache and downloads. In the case of appcache, DocumentLoader might not have a chance to
            check for substitute data until the original load has finished, wasting bandwidth, and might receive duplicate
            or out-of-order callbacks. In the case of downloads, it would often be too late to convert the existing
            connection to a download, leading to restarted downloads or outright failures.

            Bandaids were put in place for these issues in r188150, r188486, and r188851 to fix crashes or serious
            regressions in behavior, but these weren't complete fixes. They did not solve any of the duplicate data loading
            problems, and they did not make downloads work reliably in all cases.

            This patch rolls out the bandaids (but keeps their tests) and replaces them with a more robust fix. Instead of
            hiding callbacks from DocumentLoader, ContentFilter now delivers willSendRequest(), redirectReceived(), and
            responseReceived() to DocumentLoader immediately, and cancels filtering if DocumentLoader decides to ignore the
            load, download it, or load substitute data. ContentFilter continues to buffer incoming data to prevent partial
            rendering of blocked content.

            The existing tests for r188150 and r188851 were kept, the test for r188486 was rewritten to be specific to
            content filtering, and new tests were added to cover the case where ContentFilter is still undecided after a
            load finishes.

            When we received notification that the GPU has reset,
            we were nulling out and deleting our OpenGL contexts
            and then trying to do it all over again. The fix was
            to flip the order of operations.

            While there I added some logging, and changed the
            way we check GPU status to make sure we do a check
            after the first draw call.

            Unfortunately we can't test automatically because it
            involves resetting the GPU which can possibly cause

            [Cocoa] Punctuation near Hindi text is garbled when styled with the system font
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148164

            Reviewed by Brian Burg.

            Fonts cache whether or not they are the system font. This caching took place at the end of Font::platformInit().
            However, in the middle of Font::platformInit(), we look up a glyph, which calls GlyphPage::fill() which consults
            with this cache. However, at this point, the cache has not been constructed yet. The solution is just to
            construct the cache earlier (at the beginning of the function).

            Consulting with the cache before it is populated causes it to erroneously say that no fonts are system fonts.
            Then, we use Core Graphics to ask for glyphs instead of Core Text. Core Graphics, however, is incapable of
            handling the system font, and returns us garbled results. In particular, when the system language is set to
            Japanese, the system font does not support punctuation, and Core Text tells us so. However, Core Graphics
            erroneously tells us that the system font does support punctuation.

            Then, if text is near the punctuation which causes us to take the complex text codepath (such as Hindi text),
            we tell Core Text to explicitly lay out the punctuation using the system font (which does not support
            punctuation). Core Text then replies that the provided font doesn't support the punctuation, and that we should
            use LastResort with some other glyphs instead. WebKit then disregards the font CoreText told us to use (because
            we are oh-so-sure that the font in question supports punctuation) and uses the LastResort glyph IDs with our
            font, which causes arbitrary glyphs to be shown.

            A renderer should never be assigned to multiple selection subtrees. (Currently RenderObject maintains the last selection state.)
            RenderView::applySubtreeSelection() loops from the start to the end of the selection to find renderers that are inside the selection.
            However, in case of regions (when multiple selection roots are present) traversing the renderer tree by calling RenderObject::nextInPreOrder() could
            end up going across selection roots.
            This patch ensures that we assign renderers to a specific selection only when the current selection root and the renderer's selection root match.

            When two seekWithTolerance() requests come in before the first is acted upon in seekTask(),
            the second will result in a "no seek required" conditional, because the new "currentTime" is

            When cancelling a pending seek, first replace the "now" value with the "now" value from the

            In order to perform font fallback, we must know which fonts support which characters. We
            perform this check by asking each font to map a sequence of codepoints to glyphs, and
            any glyphs which end up with a 0 value are unsupported by the font.

            One of the mechanisms that we use to do this is to combine the code points into a string,
            and tell Core Text to lay out the string. However, this is fundamentally a different
            operation than the one we are trying to perform. Strings combine adjacent codepoints into
            grapheme clusters, and CoreText operates on these. However, we are trying to gain
            information regarding codepoints, not grapheme clusters.

            Instead of taking this string-based approach, we should try harder to use Core Text
            functions which operate on ordered collections of characters, rather than strings. In
            particular, CTFontGetGlyphsForCharacters() and CTFontGetVerticalGlyphsForCharacters()
            have the behavior we want where any unmapped characters end up with a 0 value glyph.

            Previously, we were only using the result of those functions if they were successfully
            able to map their entire input. However, given the fact that we can degrade gracefully
            in the case of a partial mapping, we shouldn't need to bail completely to the
            string-based approach should a partial mapping occur.

            At some point we should delete the string-based approach entirely. However, this path
            is still explicitly used for composite fonts. Fixing that use case is out of scope
            for this patch.

            When we are wrapping up processing of the wheel event for a given frame, if the current latching context
            does NOT apply to the current frame (e.g., because it's latched to an enclosing frame) we should not pass
            wheel events directly to the latched elements scrollable container. Instead, we should just give the current
            frame an opportunity to perform any custom wheel event handling and return, so that the enclosing (latched)
            frame can do the rest of its event handling.

            If we don't do this, we incorrectly ask the enclosing frame to process the event, then return claiming that
            we handled the event, preventing the enclosing frame from doing its part of the processing.

            r186597 moved the call to addPlugInStreamLoader to willSendRequest. This is wrong since
            willSendRequest can be invoked more than once.

            Fix this by making the initialization phase of NetscapePlugInStreamLoader be more like
            SubresourceLoader where we only call addPlugInStreamLoader once we've successfully initialized
            the loader, and only call removePlugInStreamLoader if we've called addPlugInStreamLoader.

            Animations sometimes fail to start

            Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

            When an accelerated animation or transition was started at the same time as
            a non-accelerated one, and then the node for the former was removed, we could
            never kick off the non-accelerated animation.

            AnimationControllerPrivate has logic to synchronize the two types of animation
            when they start in the same animation update, which involves setting the
            m_waitingForAsyncStartNotification flag, and waiting for a notifyAnimationStarted()
            to come in from the graphics system.

            However, it failed to handle the case where the accelerated animation was removed
            before the callback was received, which left the m_waitingForAsyncStartNotification flag
            set to true, preventing the non-accelerated animation from running.

            On OS X, we do not have such an assumption, and we handle the case where it

            Rename deleteCookiesForHostname to deleteCookiesForHostnames and
            make it take a vector of hostnames instead.

            Also, fix the Mac implementation to not be O(n2) by putting all cookies
            in a dictionary keyed on the domain.

            Also make sure to call _saveStorage after deleting cookies.

            Finally, get rid of deleteCookiesForHostname from CookieJarCFNet.cpp and
            use the Mac implementation on iOS as well. Just stub out deleteCookiesForHostnames

            Blurry inline video controls are the result of transform scaling up the content when the page
            is zoomed out (page scale > 1).
            This patch addresses the blurriness by switching to css zoom when the content is being scaled up.
            While transform scale is a paint time operation, css zoom triggers layout and the content is getting
            painted on a non-scaled graphics context.

            Overlap testing for compositing uses the currently laid out position of fixed
            elements, without taking into account the fact that async scrolling can move
            them around, and possibly under other non-composited elements. This manifested
            as position:fixed elements moving over other elements on some pages when
            scrolling, when they should have moved behind.

            Fix by expanding the overlap map entry for position:fixed elements to create
            an rect for the area they cover at all scroll locations, taking min and max
            scroll offsets into account.

            Also add a couple more LOG(Compositing) statements.

            StyleSheetContents::wrapperInsertRule() can create rules that overflow RuleData's selector index
            https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147144

            Reviewed by Alex Christensen.

            RuleData identifies selectors by the index in a large array. The index only has 13 bits
            so rules with more than 8192 selectors should be split.

            One of the paths was not splitting the rule: StyleSheetContents::wrapperInsertRule().
            When rules with too many selectors were added, the index would overflow and
            some RuleData would point to selectors in the middle of selector chains. The resulting
            behavior is random based on the selectors and the DOM.

            We cannot easily fix that because the CSS OM API do not expect to create
            several rules in response to calls to the API.
            In this patch, I don't do anything fancy and just let the calls fail
            if we cannot use the rules safely.


            Content Extensions were also running into this problem. Large Selector lists are
            pretty common, and ContentExtensionStyleSheet::addDisplayNoneSelector() was
            overflowing the RuleData, creating broken page.

            Unlike CSSOM, there is no problem with splitting rules coming from Content Extensions.
            Instead of creating new APIs for that case, I rely on the parser to extend the StyleSheetContents.
            That code already knows how to break rules correctly.

            The fixed-attached background-image rendering is special. In general, to
            display it, the destinationSize should be set to visibleContentSize. The
            destinationLocation should be set such that the background-image does
            not move with scrolling. The topContentInset should be subtracted from
            the destinationLocation such that background-image can be rendered blurred
            in the topContentArea. However there are cases in which these rules have to
            be changed.

            -- destinationSize: In the case of fixed layout size, the fixedLayoutSize
            is bigger than the visibleContentSize. In this case, if the background-image
            belongs to the root element, the destinationSize has to be set to fixedLayoutSize.
            Otherwise it has to be set to the borderBoxSize unless the overflow is
            hidden.

            -- destinationLocation: If the background-image belongs to the root element, no
            scroll offset to added to destinationLocation. For non-root element case,
            FrameView::documentScrollOffsetRelativeToViewOrigin() should be used if no page
            scaling is applied. Otherwise FrameView::scrollOffsetForFixedPosition() should be
            used instead.
