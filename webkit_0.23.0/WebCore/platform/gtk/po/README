=======================
WebKitGTK+ Localization
=======================

WebKitGTK+'s build system is very unorthodox. This means that you will
not get to run the usual make commands in the po directory.

To refresh the .pot file, go to the root of the build directory, and
run `make webkit.pot-update'. To update the .po files using the new
.pot file run `make update-po'. This will also build the .mo files.
