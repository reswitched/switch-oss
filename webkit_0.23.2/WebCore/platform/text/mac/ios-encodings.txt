# We'd like to eliminate this file.
# It would be nice to get rid of dependence on the TextEncodingConvert entirely.
# Perhaps we can prove these are not used on the web and remove them.
# Or perhaps we can get them added to ICU.

# The items on the left are names of TEC TextEncoding values (without the leading kTextEncoding).
# The items on the right are IANA character set names. Names listed in character-sets.txt are not
# repeated here; mentioning any one character set from a group in there pulls in all the aliases in
# that group.

# No encodings for iOS
