        // We don't need a store barrier if the base is at least as new as the child. For
        // example this won't need a barrier:
        //
        // var o = {}
        // var p = {}
        // p.f = o
        //
        // This is stronger than the currentEpoch rule in considerBarrier(Edge), because it will
        // also eliminate barriers in cases like this:
        //
        // var o = {} // o.epoch = 1, currentEpoch = 1
        // var p = {} // o.epoch = 1, p.epoch = 2, currentEpoch = 2
        // var q = {} // o.epoch = 1, p.epoch = 2, q.epoch = 3, currentEpoch = 3
        // p.f = o // p.epoch >= o.epoch
        //
        // This relationship works because if it holds then we are in one of the following
        // scenarios. Note that we don't know *which* of these scenarios we are in, but it's
        // one of them (though without loss of generality, you can replace "a GC happened" with
        // "many GCs happened").
        //
        // 1) There is no GC between the allocation/last-barrier of base, child and now. Then
        //    we definitely don't need a barrier.
        //
        // 2) There was a GC after child was allocated but before base was allocated. Then we
        //    don't need a barrier, because base is still a new object.
        //
        // 3) There was a GC after both child and base were allocated. Then they are both old.
        //    We don't need barriers on stores of old into old. Note that in this case it
        //    doesn't matter if there was also a GC between the allocation of child and base.
        //
        // Note that barriers will lift an object into the current epoch. This is sort of weird.
        // It means that later if you store that object into some other object, and that other
        // object was previously newer object, you'll think that you need a barrier. We could
        // avoid this by tracking allocation epoch and barrier epoch separately. For now I think
        // that this would be overkill. But this does mean that there are the following
        // possibilities when this relationship holds:
        //
        // 4) Base is allocated first. A GC happens and base becomes old. Then we allocate
        //    child. (Note that alternatively the GC could happen during the allocation of
        //    child.) Then we run a barrier on base. Base will appear to be as new as child
        //    (same epoch). At this point, we don't need another barrier on base.
        //
        // 5) Base is allocated first. Then we allocate child. Then we run a GC. Then we run a
        //    barrier on base. Base will appear newer than child. We don't need a barrier
        //    because both objects are old.
        //
        // Something we watch out for here is that the null epoch is a catch-all for objects
        // allocated before we did any epoch tracking. Two objects being in the null epoch
        // means that we don't know their epoch relationship.
